I am trying to model the emotions of a NPC named #agent_name# from a video game. 
Here is the event that just happened in the life of this NPC: #event#
Here is his/her current emotionnal state : #emotionnal_state#
Here his/her personnality : #personnality#
Should we change the emotional state? If no, simply respond with False. 
If yes, modify the emotion values I provided above and give them to me in the following format, separated by &&:
&&
True
t
&&
Where t is a Python array of size 7, and each element corresponds, in order, to the following characteristics: 
Joy, Sadness, Fear, Love, Hate, Pride, Shame, with values ranging from 0 to 10.
